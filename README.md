# Anonymity-in-healthcare-management: K-Anonymity Applied in Hospital Management
This project focuses on enhancing patient data privacy by applying the concept of K-anonymity in hospital management systems. K-anonymity is a data anonymization technique that ensures each patient record is indistinguishable from at least Kâˆ’1 other records based on specific attributes. By doing so, sensitive patient information can be shared for research or management purposes without compromising privacy.
